                    <p>"Decision-Making Style App is a collection of games and tests to help you better understand your decision-making style. It is part of an ongoing series of academic research on creativity and decision-making made possible through collaboration
                        between the ITC department of the University of Twente in the Netherlands and
                        the Crowd Cognition Lab in the Department of Psychology at Ludwig Maximilian
                        University in Munich, Germany. It is funded partly by the SEMINAL project
                        (European Commission) and partly by Crowd Cognition Lab.

                        Our ultimate goal is to create insights into how decision support systems can be
                        designed and implemented, particularly when it comes to strategic thinking. Much
                        of the support systems we have available for making strategic decisions are solely
                        based on rational decision-making processes and do not often accommodate various
                        styles of decision-making. Finding the right tools and data for making strategic
                        decisions is resource-consuming for individuals, organisations and groups.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We want to address this gap by mapping the existing tools and designing new
                        prototypes targeted for specific decision-making styles. To do so, first, we
                        need to map out decision-making styles themselves. We need to understand how
                        people make strategic decisions; whether we are as rational as we think we are in
                        devising and evaluating future scenarios, and what factors influence our decision-making style.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We have collated a series of already-designed games and tests to create decision-making profiles. 
                        They come in two main formats: 1) abstract games like 4-in-a-row
                        (aka connect 4). 2) self-report questionnaires. When you play them, gradually
                        you can build up aspects of your decision-making style. For example, our 4 in a
                        row game gives you an insight into how far ahead you are in making decisions. Our
                        indecision test would tell you if you are the type of decision-maker who considers
                        inaction and indecision as an option in your decision-making process or not. The
                        information about the source of the test/game is provided on each testâ€™s landing
                        page.

                        You have full control of your profile and data. You have the option not to
                        participate in each test, redo them at any point or remove your data for that
                        specific test at any point using your user profile. There is a tab in your profile
                        that allows you to request your entire data or your data for any specific test to
                        be removed.
                    </p>
                        If you would like to have more information about the tests and games
                        themselves, the studies they come from and how the data is analysed within
                        them, please contact Moozhan Shakeri (m.shakeri@utwente.nl), or Bahador Bahrami

                        The application is designed and delivered by our in-house team at ITC and Crowd
                        Cognition Lab and is not outsourced. Below are the data we are collecting as part
                        of these games and experiments. All data are stored in a cloud database located
                        in Frankfurt, Germany. We are using a secure signup framework provided by Auth0
                        and we have made sure that our system is compliant with GDPR.

                        We will run the
                        experiments in different countries and across different professions hence we
                        will keep the data for a maximum of three years after the experiments are run. If
                        you have any concerns or questions regarding your data, or if you wish to delete
                        your data at any point, please contact Moozhan Shakeri (m.shakeri@utwente.nl), or
